#### 🚀 PauseOne – Definitive Feature List

_(Crafted for maximum differentiation with minimum surface area)_

**Core Experience**

- **One-Tap Start** – open → single button → instant 60-sec session; no sign-up, no menu.
- **Micro-Session Picker** – long-press to swap 30 s / 60 s / 120 s; remembers last choice.
- **Liquid-Glass Breathing Orb** – on-trend translucent circle that gently scales for inhale/exhale.
- **Silent Haptic Guidance** – vibration patterns replace audio; office-safe & headphone-free.

**Personal Calm Layer**

- **Adaptive Pace** – automatically shortens or lengthens breath cycle after 3 uses based on accelerometer-detected chest motion (opt-in).
- **Guilt-Free Streak Ring** – visible while active, gracefully hides after 24 h lapse to avoid shame loops.
- **Theme Quick-Swap** – swipe left/right on Home to flip through 5 free gradient glass skins (20 premium).

**Organic Growth Hooks**

- **Share-A-Pause Link** – one tap copies a URL that autoplays the same micro-session on any browser.
- **Slack / Teams Slash Command** – `/pause` posts a live “Take 1-Minute Break” button to the channel.
- **Lock-Screen Widget** – displays remaining seconds of your last pause; friends notice, ask, install.

**Platform & Access**

- **Zero-Install PWA** – opens full experience inside any share link; prompt to “Add to Home Screen” after 3rd visit.
- **Capacitor Wrapper** – native build only 4 MB, unlocks reliable push + haptics on iOS/Android.
- **Offline-First** – entire code + assets cached on first load; works in airplane mode.

**Monetization (But Still KISS)**

- **One-Time Forever Unlock ($4.99)**  
  • 20 liquid-glass themes  
  • Advanced haptic patterns  
  • Daily gentle reminder tone
- **Team Pulse Dashboard ($1 / user / mo)** – anonymized “pause minutes” insight for HR & remote teams.

**Delight Extras**

- **End-Card Affirmations** – silent, single-line quotes fade in as the session ends.
- **Gestural Easter Egg** – two-finger rotate the orb → switches to monochrome “stealth mode”.

**Compliance & Care**

- **WCAG 2.2 AA** – large text toggle, color-blind safe palette.
- **Prefers-Reduced-Motion** – disables orb scaling, keeps haptics.
- **No Data Storage** – all stats local unless user opts into cloud sync.

This tightly scoped set delivers a **distinctive micro-meditation utility, viral by design, with zero friction**—the essence of PauseOne.
