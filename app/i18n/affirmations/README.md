## JSON File Format

Each language file follows this structure:

  "affirmations": [
    "First affirmation text...",
    "Second affirmation text..."
    // ... 100 total affirmations
  ]
}
```

## Affirmation Content Philosophy

All affirmations are crafted with the following principles:

### Buddhist-Inspired Wisdom

- Rooted in mindfulness and present-moment awareness
- Emphasize interconnectedness and compassion
- Focus on inner peace and self-acceptance
- Promote non-attachment and acceptance of impermanence

### Deep Meaning

- Avoid clichéd or superficial statements
- Address fundamental human experiences
- Encourage self-reflection and growth
- Provide comfort during difficult times

### Universal Resonance

- Applicable across cultures and backgrounds
- Address common human struggles and aspirations
- Promote healing and personal transformation
- Encourage authentic self-expression

### Examples of Affirmation Themes

1. **Breath and Presence**
   - "Your breath is the bridge between your body and your soul."
   - "Each breath you take is a gift of life itself."

2. **Inner Wisdom**
   - "The wisdom you need is already within you."
   - "Your inner light guides you through any darkness."

3. **Interconnectedness**
   - "You are connected to all beings through the web of compassion."
   - "You are both the wave and the ocean."

4. **Acceptance and Growth**
   - "Your struggles are the soil from which your strength grows."
   - "You are both perfectly imperfect and completely whole."

5. **Present Moment Awareness**
   - "The present moment is your greatest teacher."
   - "Each moment offers you a chance to begin again."

## Usage

The affirmation system is accessed through the `affirmationService.ts` file:

```typescript
import { getRandomAffirmation, getUserLanguage } from "../services/affirmationService"

// Get a random affirmation in user's language
const affirmation = getRandomAffirmation()

// Get user's detected language
const userLang = getUserLanguage()

// Get affirmation for specific language
const spanishAffirmation = getRandomAffirmationForLanguage("es")
```

## Language Detection

The system automatically detects the user's preferred language using:

1. **Device Locale**: Reads system locale settings
2. **Language Matching**: Matches primary language code (e.g., 'en-US' → 'en')
3. **Fallback Strategy**: Falls back to English if language not supported
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with default affirmations

## Quality Assurance

Each language file has been carefully crafted to ensure:

- **Accuracy**: Proper translation and cultural adaptation
- **Consistency**: Uniform tone and style across languages
- **Completeness**: Exactly 100 affirmations per language
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Appropriate for diverse audiences
- **Spiritual Depth**: Meaningful content that promotes well-being

## Integration

The affirmation system integrates seamlessly with:

- **React Native Components**: Used in AffirmationCard component
- **i18n System**: Works alongside existing internationalization
- **Expo Localization**: Leverages device locale detection
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful handling of loading failures

## Maintenance

To add a new language:

1. Create a new JSON file with the language code (e.g., `pt-br.json`)
2. Add 100 carefully crafted affirmations following the content philosophy
3. Update the `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` object in `affirmationService.ts`
4. Test language detection and fallback behavior

## Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Affirmations loaded only when needed
- **Memory Efficient**: Only active language kept in memory
- **Fast Access**: Direct array indexing for random selection
- **Error Recovery**: Robust fallback mechanisms prevent crashes

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements include:

- **Personalization**: User-selected favorite affirmations
- **Scheduling**: Time-based affirmation delivery
- **Categories**: Themed affirmation collections
- **Audio**: Spoken affirmations with proper pronunciation
- **Offline Support**: Cached affirmations for offline use
